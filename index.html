   <h2>Information</h2>
   <p style="text-align: justify">Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale; Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7]

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.[7][8] Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women,[9] Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims[10] and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.[11]
        
        Opinions about Shivaji have varied by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.[12][13][14]
        
        Early life</p>


        <h2 class="#shi">Early life</h2><img src="earlylife.jpg" style="float: left;padding: 10;"> was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
             Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday
              commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).Shivaji was named after a local deity, 
              the goddess Shivai Devi. <br>Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served
               the Deccan Sultanates.His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed,
                a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri. Shivaji belonged
                 to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an 
                 influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja".<br> 
                 He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. 
                 He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590).<br>At the time of Shivaji's birth, 
                 power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji
                  often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the 
                  Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
